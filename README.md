## ⚡ Fun fact
The first computer bug was an actual bug! In 1947, Grace Hopper and her team found a moth trapped in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer. 
They taped the moth in their logbook and wrote, "First actual case of bug being found." 
This incident popularized the terms "bug" and "debugging" in computer programming.
